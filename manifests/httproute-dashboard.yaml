# Dashboard route — self-referential Gateway API routing
#   traefik.localhost  ->  Traefik's own API/dashboard (port 9000)
#
# Traffic arrives at the Gateway on port 80, is matched by this HTTPRoute,
# and is forwarded to the "traefik" Kubernetes Service on port 9000.
# Traefik then serves its own dashboard UI and API at that port.
#
# This HTTPRoute is in the "traefik" namespace, same as the backend Service,
# so no ReferenceGrant is needed.
