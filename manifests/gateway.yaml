# Explicit Gateway definition.
#
# We manage this ourselves rather than relying on the Helm chart's auto-created
# Gateway so we can control two things precisely:
#
#   port: 8000  — Traefik's "web" entrypoint runs internally on port 8000.
#                 The hostPort (80) is just the node-level binding; the
#                 Gateway listener must match the *entrypoint* port.
#
#   from: All   — Allow HTTPRoutes from any namespace (e.g. "demo") to attach
#                 to this Gateway without needing a ReferenceGrant.
